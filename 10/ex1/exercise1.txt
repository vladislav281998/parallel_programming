Observations
Sequential and Sequential Recursive Performance:

Both the sequential and sequential recursive implementations show very low computation times across all sizes.
The sequential recursive times are generally on par with or slightly faster than the sequential times.

Parallel Performance:

The parallel implementation takes significantly more time than the sequential and sequential recursive implementations for all sizes.
Despite being parallel, it does not demonstrate a reduction in computation time, suggesting inefficiencies.
Main Bottleneck of Parallel Implementation
The primary bottleneck in the parallel implementation appears to be overhead associated with parallel processing. This includes:

Task Creation and Management:

Dividing the problem into parallel tasks, managing these tasks, and then combining the results incurs overhead 
that can outweigh the benefits of parallelism for small problem sizes.

Synchronization Costs:

Synchronizing the results from different threads or processes can add significant overhead, especially i
f the tasks are small and numerous.
Communication Overhead:

Communication between threads or processes, particularly in shared memory architectures, can introduce latency.
