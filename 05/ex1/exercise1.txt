The provided code can be enhanced for better performance by eliminating unnecessary parallel regions, utilizing more advanced matrix multiplication strategies, addressing false sharing concerns, and optimizing memory management.

1. Redundant Parallel Regions:
   - The program includes two nested `#pragma omp parallel` directives, which can lead to excessive overhead.
   - Combining the tasks of matrix multiplication and summing matrix 'c' into a single parallel region could streamline execution.
   - The additional `#pragma omp parallel for` used for summing matrix 'c' is redundant as it falls within an existing parallel region and could be merged.

2. Matrix Multiplication Efficiency:
   - Currently, the matrix multiplication is performed using a basic triple nested loop approach, which is inefficient regarding cache utilization.
   - Implementing an advanced algorithm, such as divide-and-conquer, can significantly boost performance by improving cache efficiency.

3. Avoiding False Sharing:
   - The `local_res` array is accessed by multiple threads where each thread writes to a specific index determined by `omp_get_thread_num()`. This setup can cause false sharing if multiple indices reside on the same cache line.
   - To prevent this, consider using the `#pragma omp parallel for reduction(+:res)` to handle result accumulation, which inherently avoids false sharing issues.

4. Initialization Inside Parallel Regions:
   - Matrices `a` and `b` are initialized within a parallel region, potentially adding unnecessary overhead due to repeated initialization tasks.
   - Moving the initialization of these matrices outside the parallel regions can reduce overhead and focus the parallel execution solely on computation.

5. Compiler Optimization Flags:
   - Ensure that the compilation includes optimization flags such as `-O3` to maximize performance optimizations automatically performed by the compiler.
