Improvements in the C Code:

1. Memory Allocation Improvements
   a. Contiguous Memory Allocation for Arrays:
      - INIT_ARRAY macro redefined to allocate a single contiguous block of memory for each matrix (a, b, and c).
      - Reduces malloc calls from n+1 to 1 per matrix, improving cache locality and performance.

   b. Initialization of Matrix Elements:
      - Matrix elements are initialized to zero within the INIT_ARRAY macro using nested loops.

2. Function Simplification
   a. Simplified free_2d_array Function:
      - Directly frees the memory block allocated for the matrices, reflecting the new allocation strategy and reducing complexity.

3. Computational Optimizations
   a. Loop Reordering for Improved Cache Efficiency:
      - Order of loops changed (j, i, k instead of i, j, k) to enhance spatial locality and reduce cache misses.

   b. Use of Linear Indexing:
      - Matrix operations use linear indexing (i * n + j) to simplify index calculations and align with single-block memory layout.

4. Parallelism Adjustments
   a. Optimized OpenMP Directives:
      - Replaced inner #pragma omp parallel for with #pragma omp for to avoid nested parallel regions.
      - Specified schedule(static) to improve workload distribution across threads.
