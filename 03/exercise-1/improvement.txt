Can you think of a way to parallelize this algorithm?

Yes, the Mandelbrot set calculation can be efficiently parallelized due to the independent nature of the pixel computations. A straightforward approach is to use multi-threading, where the image space is divided among several threads, each responsible for computing the Mandelbrot set for its allocated portion of the image. This division can be done by rows or blocks, assigning each thread a specific segment of the image to work on. The threads perform their computations in parallel, filling in their respective sections of the image array. This method leverages the fact that each pixel's calculation is isolated, requiring no data from the computation of neighboring pixels, thus avoiding the need for synchronization mechanisms. After all threads have completed their tasks, the fully assembled image represents the Mandelbrot set. This parallelization strategy significantly reduces the overall computation time by utilizing multiple processors or cores concurrently.
