Perf Analysis:
FP_COMP_OPS_EXE.SSE2_INTEGER
"In executing a program, operation of a computer consists of a sequence of instruction cycles, with one machine instruction per cycle. 
Each instruction cycle is made up of a number of smaller units â€“ Fetch, Indirect, Execute and Interrupt cycles. 
Each of these cycles involves series of steps, each of which involves the processor registers"

12.355 SSE2 Integer micro-operations were executed.

FP_COMP_OPS_EXE.SSE_FP_PACKED
1.024.127.154 executed

Packed operations are operations where multiple elements are packed into a single SSE register and the same operation is perfomred on all those packed elements simultaneously.
So this indicates that our program is utilizing vectorization.
