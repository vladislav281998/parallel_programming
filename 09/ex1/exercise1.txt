For vectorisation was used -ftree-vectorize flag, and to switch off any optimisation was used -OO flag

Performance Gain:
Both the versions with optimisation show significant speedups compared to the version with no optimization.
The vectorised version with optimisation achieves much higher speedups than the only optimised version, 
indicating that it is more efficient, possibly due to better utilization of vectorization and other optimizations.

Correctness:
Assuming the outputs, are correct and consistent across all runs, the results are correct.
Each result's consistency indicates that vectorization did not introduce any numerical errors.

Effect of Problem Size:

The speedups generally increase with larger problem sizes, which is expected. 
Larger datasets benefit more from vectorization as more data can be processed in parallel.
