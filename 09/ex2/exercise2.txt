Observations:
- Auto-Vectorization and OpenMP are nearly identical in performance.

Correctness Confirmation:
- Is the result still correct? Yes.

Performance Findings:
- 500,000,057 PACKED_SINGLE Events (Add + Mul)
- 1,000,002,159 VECTOR Events (Store + Load) => One of them is probably not being vectorized.
- 1,500,009,227 Total Events

Double to Float Conversion Findings:
- Time (double) = 1.637 s
- Time (float) = 0.865 s
- Optimisation is the same, but since double is twice as big as float, only half as many values can be calculated using a single vectorized instruction.

Performance Summary:
- 1,000,000,000 PACKED_DOUBLE Events (Add + Mul)
- 2,000,000,153 VECTOR Events (Store + Load) => One of them is probably not being vectorized.
- 3,000,007,227 Total Events

Comparison with Exercise 1:
- How does the solution for this exercise compare to Exercise 1?
  Auto-Vectorization and OpenMP are nearly identical in performance.

Advantages and Disadvantages:
- Advantages: Better because you don't need compiler flags and you know which loops are vectorized.
- Disadvantages: None that we found.
