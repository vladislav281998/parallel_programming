Observations:
- Auto-Vectorization and OpenMP are nearly identical in performance.

Correctness Confirmation:
- Is the result still correct? Yes.

Findings on converting double to float precision:
- Execution time for the double precision version (omp_vectorized_double) is notably longer than the single precision version (omp_vectorized_float). This is due to the increased CPU resource demand of double precision operations, which involve larger data sizes and more complex arithmetic.
- The performance counters for float operations, particularly r1010:u, indicate the usage of single precision SIMD instructions (FP_COMP_OPS_EXE.SSE_FP_PACKED). This similarity in counter readings between float and double suggests heavy reliance on single precision SIMD instructions for both, indicating possible optimization issues for double precision SIMD or translation errors by the compiler.

Comparison with Exercise 1:
- How does the solution for this exercise compare to Exercise 1?
  Auto-Vectorization and OpenMP are nearly identical in performance.

Advantages and Disadvantages:
- Advantages: Better because you don't need compiler flags and you know which loops are vectorized.
- Disadvantages: None that we found.
