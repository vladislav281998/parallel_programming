Code Snippet 1:

There is a RAW dependency because the value of factor depends on the previous iteration of the loop.
There is also an anti dependency since factor is used and then later updated.

Code Snippet 2:

Again there is a RAW dependency, x[i] depends on the value of y[i-1] calculated in the previous iteration.
Both x[i] and y[i] are read and then written to, which is are anti dependencies.

Code Snippet 3:

True dependencies on x[Ã­-1] since it depends on x[i-1] calculated in the previous iteration
Anti dependencies on x[i] and x[i-1]
