2.) Here in the loop, i + 2 and j - 1 use the values of variables i and j from the outer and inner loops respectively.

This means that each element a[i + 2][j - 1] is overwritten in every iteration of the inner loop, 
but with different values of variables i and j.

Thus, in this code snippet, there is a data dependence present, known as a data dependence, 
because the value of elements of array a depends on the values of other elements of the same array.

3.) In this case, the inner loop cannot be parallelized because each iteration of the inner loop depends on the previous 
iteration due to the use of elements of the array a. To enable parallel execution, 
it might be necessary to introduce an additional variable to avoid this dependency.
