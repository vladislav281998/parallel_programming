Code Snippet 1:
-There is a read-after-write (RAW) dependency on the x array. The value of x[i] depends on the value of x[i+1] from the previous iteration.
-There is a read-only dependency on the y array. The value of y[i] is read in each iteration but not modified.

Code Snippet 2:
-There are no dependencies between iterations of the loop, as each iteration reads from x[i] and y[i] and writes to z[i] independently.
-The variable a is used within the loop but not carried across iterations, so it can be safely declared as a private variable in the optimized code.
-The variable f is computed after the loop and depends on the last value of a, but it does not affect the parallelization of the loop.

Code Snippet 3:
-In the first loop, there are no dependencies between iterations, as each iteration reads from y[i] and writes to x[i] independently.
-In the second loop, there is a read-after-write (RAW) dependency between the two loops, as the second loop reads the values of x[i] that were written in the first loop. However, since the loops are executed sequentially, this dependency is naturally resolved.
-Within each loop, there are no dependencies between iterations, as each iteration reads from x[i] and writes to y[i] independently.
