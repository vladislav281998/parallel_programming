OMP_PROC_BIND=True

OMP_PROC_BIND=True binds threads to a specific OpenMP place for its lifetime.
This avoids the potential extensive overhead introduced by dynamically moving threads.

OMP_PLACES={0:1:1} OMP_PLACES=sockets

OMP_PLACES={0:1:1} creates a single place for all threads at core 0.
OMP_PLACES=sockets allows OpenMP to spread the threads across all available sockets.

OMP_PLACES={0:1:1} is by far faster, most likely because of better cache utilization. Since sum is kept in 
cache accesable to all threads, the updated version does not have to be retrieved from main memory.

OMP_PLACES=sockets Inter-socket communication especially in regards to the atomic synchronization introduces significant overhead.
In fact even omitting OMP_PLACES entirely is faster.
Performance wise this is equivalent to omitting both OMP_PROC_BIND=True and OMP_PLACES since without OMP_PROC_BIND=True threads can
run (and be moved) on all available cores, also introducing the overhead from inter-socket communication.
