Exercise 1 (1.5 Points)
Description:
Optimize the execution time of a program on a scalar architecture by applying strength reduction to the following code snippets.

Tasks:
Apply strength reduction.
State under which circumstances the transformation should be applied.
Compare the assembly code of the original snippets with your transformation.
Investigate how the compiler optimizes the snippets using -O3 optimization flag.
